- I am a Vietnamese people, Capricorn male, born on January 17, 2000. Originally from Hanoi, I now reside in vibrant Ho Chi Minh City. A proud graduate of the Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City (IUH), I currently work as an IT engineer, with evenings generally free to explore my personal interests.
- I am passionate about savoring morning coffee, listening to Calum Scottâ€™s heartfelt music, traveling, and immersing myself in the beauty of the sea. I particularly enjoy the cool weather of Da Lat and the serene beaches of Phan Thiet.
- While I am single and open to finding a meaningful relationship, my work commitments often keep me busy, leaving limited time to focus on love for now.
- In addition to my professional work, I am also developing a personal AI project, which you can find on my GitHub: https://github.com/HuskyDG/automatic_fb.
